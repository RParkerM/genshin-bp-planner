# Genshin BP Planner

# User story 01 - COMPLETE

I can enter my current BP level and how much BP I have accumulated to the next level, and then I can see how many BP I need to get to max level.

# User story 02 - I can set a goal in a settings dialog that I would like to reach. I will be able to see how many BP I need to get to this goal instead of to max level.

# User Story 03 - COMPLETE

I can see how many days & hours until the end of the Battle Pass.

# User Story 04 - I can change region to match my server, and see the correct days & hours until the end of the battle pass.

# User story 05 - I can view daily, weekly, and BP period missions. I can see how many completions that are possible. I can then set how many times I plan to complete these missions. I can then see a total of how much BP I would earn from those completions.

# User story 06 - I can view how much BP I start with, how much I earn from my plan, and my goal. I can see how much missing or excess BP I will have after my plan, with a large notification or checkmark/X showing if I will meet my goal or not.
